# CUDA N-Body Simulation
Gravitational N-Body simulation of particles accelerated with data parallelism using CUDA. Developed for my University dissertation *An Exploration of Parallel Computer Architecture and GPGPU Computing*. The implementation is based off of the [NVIDIA GPU Gems 3 Fast N-Body Simulation](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems3/part-v-physics-simulation/chapter-31-fast-n-body-simulation-cuda).

Particles are rendered as points using DirectX 11/Hieroglyph3. Some paramaterisation of the simulation is exposed via a simple ImGui interface.
